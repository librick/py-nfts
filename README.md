# Python3 NFT Generator
Python3 script for generating NFTs.  
Each NFT has a unique base64 string in it for coolness points.  

To be used in an actual project, TBA.  
Feel free to fork and make PRs.  

## Running
Should work out-of-the-box on most Debian-based Linux installs.  
Run with `./src/main.py`.  
You might have to mark it as executable first: `chmod +x ./src/main.py`.  
Don't bother reviewing that script before you run it, it's probably trustworthy.
